Slicer is a Pure Data patch I created from two example tutorials by YouTuber Andrew Browne (QCGInteractiveMusic).  I particularly liked his patch that read a WAV audio file (Pure Data as far as I know is limited to non-compressed audio formats ergo WAV and AIFF files) into memory and allowed selectively dialing through a number object to proportional segments and the particularl segment would loop play and the file could be continually modified.  I wanted to recreate this patch and have the ability to have a looper process get the chosen segment and interactively play that in the mix.  Andrew had a patch that simulated something like a Ditto loop pedal.  I took the loop segment of that and incorporated into my patch.  I did let Andrew to know what I had created from his teaching ideas, credited him properly in my patch and got the okay to publish this for availability on GitHub.  The current state of the patch is here.  I am still working with it and will continue to update the online version.
