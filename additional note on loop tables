Most of my patches are written and intended to be used interactively, creating a unique piece of music each time you work with the patch.  The tables only hold content for the current patch session as they are memory resident.  That said as I mentioned in the overview file, you can export and import the loops you create for later playback sessions.  I include 5 wav files in this repository so you may import those into the patch to see what its like.  Jim
